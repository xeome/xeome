### Hey!

I'm someone who is passionate about **GNU/Linux** and likes to **write code**.

Ever since I joined GitHub **6** years ago, I pushed **717** commits, opened **19** issues, submitted **21** pull requests, received **131** stars across **28** personal projects, and contributed to **11** public repositories.

Here is a list of my **projects** that are worth mentioning:

- [riscv-kernel](https://github.com/xeome/riscv-kernel): A RISC-V kernel written in C and assembly. This project aims to implement a bare-metal kernel for the RISC-V ISA from scratch.
- [XSKNet](https://github.com/xeome/XSKNet): A high performance custom networking stack for Linux using XDP and XSK. Bypasses the kernel network stack and receives/transmits packets directly from/to the network card.
- [JCC](https://github.com/xeome/jcc): This is a self hosting C compiler I have been writing from scratch.
- [Zmem](https://github.com/xeome/zmem): A Linux memory monitoring program that displays detailed information about virtual memory.
- [xm32](https://github.com/xeome/xm32-vm): xm32 is a custom 32-bit fantasy CPU architecture and virtual machine written in rust.

Projects I have contributed to:

- [CachyOS](https://github.com/CachyOS): An Arch Linux-based distribution with heavy optimizations and multi-architecture support for an optimal desktop experience.
- [Kreato Linux](https://github.com/kreatolinux): Kreato Linux is an independent Linux(R) distribution focused on modularity, simplicity and code readability. It is inspired by the likes of Kiss Linux and Gentoo.
- [CryoUtilities](https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities): A utility to improve performance and help manage storage on Steam Deck.

Junior Linux kernel engineer obsessed with efficiency and micro optimization. Currently, I'm learning C, Linux, XDP, and go. I'm always looking for ways to make my code and systems run faster and more efficiently.
